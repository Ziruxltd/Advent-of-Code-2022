# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges from 2021 to 2024. Each year's solutions are organized into separate directories.

## Project Structure

- Each year has its own directory (e.g., `2021`, `2022`, `2023`, `2024`).
- Each day's solution is in a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `day-1.js`, `day2.js`).
- Input files for each day are stored in the `inputs` subdirectory within each year's directory.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Running the Code

1. Navigate to the directory of the year you want to run (e.g., `2023`).
2. Run the JavaScript file for the specific day using Node.js. For example, to run the solution for day 3 in 2023, use the following command:

```bash
cd 2023
node day3.js
```
